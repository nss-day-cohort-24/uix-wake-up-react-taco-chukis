Fanatic is a Wake Up App created by the Developers and UX Designers at Cock-A-Doodle-Doo.

## Summary

Your group will create a Single Page Application that is essentially a dashboard for a user to use when they wake up in the morning to keep track of the weather, news, and their favorite sports headlines.

# MVP Goals
1. Create a ReadMe with details on each function throughout the product. Each function in each component will be documented inside the readme for future programming. Images and videos are expected.
1. Using the persona from the Cock-a-Doodle-Do dashboard project, we are gearing our new product toward a sports-enthused individual who, with his busy schedule for work and other responsibilities, wants to stay in-the-know with his favorite sports headlines. 
1. Create a single-page, mobile-first application using Sports, Weather and News APIs to render the application when the user wakes up every morning.
1. Technology to use: React.js (create-react-app, re-base, react-router), Reactstrap (CSS framework), and Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
1. Commentary on each function to allow anyone to come in, read the components, and understand what each function does.


# Stretch Goals
1. Allow the user to press and hold an API section and move it anywhere on the screen to better fit their lifestyle. 
1. Future planning for other APIs to be included.
1. Add in the Spotify API to allow the user to play a song from their current / favorite playlist.
