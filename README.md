# Wake Up App - Group Project

## Summary

Your group will create a Single Page Application that is essentially a dashboard for a user to use when they wake up in the morning to keep track of the weather, news, and their favorite sports headlines.

# MVP Goals
1. Create a ReadMe with details on each function throughout the product. Each function in each component will be documented inside the readme for future programming. Images and videos are expected.
1. Using the persona from the Cock-a-Doodle-Do dashboard project, we are gearing our new product toward a sports-enthused individual who, with his busy schedule for work and other responsibilities, wants to stay in-the-know with his favorite sports headlines. 
1. Create a single-page, mobile-first application using Sports, Weather and News APIs to render the application when the user wakes up every morning.
1. Technology to use: React.js (create-react-app, re-base, react-router), Reactstrap (CSS framework), and Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
1. Commentary on each function to allow anyone to come in, read the components, and understand what each function does.


# Stretch Goals
1. Allow the user to press and hold an API section and move it anywhere on the screen to better fit their lifestyle. 
1. Future planning for other APIs to be included.
1. Add in the Spotify API to allow the user to play a song from their current / favorite playlist.


## Getting Started

> **Pro Tip:** If you find yourself writing logic on the first day of the sprint, then you did not spend enough time planning, and gaining clarification on the acceptance criteria.

1. Be sure to review your design requirements [here](https://sites.google.com/susanculkin.com/fewdd-b/home/week-14). 
1. Review the [product owner's tickets](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/group-project-uix-cock-a-doodle-doo/issues).
1. Create Firebase account for your team to use in this application.
1. Be sure to set your Firebase rules for indexing.
1. Make sure you spend time defining MVP and creating a plan to reach that goal.

## Technical Considerations
* You will be getting data from different APIs.
* User authentication using Firebase.
* The application must have CRUD functionality with the Firebase database.
* You will use components to modualize your code.
* Use a style framework.

## Technology Requirements
* React 
* CSS framework of your choice
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval\
* You may use `create-react-app`, `re-base`, `react-router`.
